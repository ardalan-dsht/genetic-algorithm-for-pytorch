# Introduction
The *GeneticAlgorithm* class is a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm designed to optimize neural network models. This README provides all the necessary information to understand, install, and use this class effectively.

# Features
* Model Optimization: Optimize any PyTorch neural network model using genetic algorithms.
* Customizable Parameters: Set population size, parent percentage, crossover threshold, and mutation threshold according to your needs.
* Device Compatibility: Run the optimization on either CPU or GPU by specifying the device.
* State Dictionary Manipulation: Deconstruct and reconstruct PyTorch model state dictionaries for genetic operations.
* Natural Selection: Select the best performing individuals based on accuracy.
* Crossover and Mutation: Perform genetic operations to generate new offspring with potential better performance.
* Training Loop: A fit method that runs the genetic algorithm for a specified number of iterations.

# Installation
To use the *GeneticAlgorithm* class, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
* torch: For neural network operations and GPU acceleration.
* sklearn: For calculating accuracy scores.
* tqdm: For progress bars during training.

You can install these packages using pip:

    pip install torch  sklearn tqdm

# Usage
To use the *GeneticAlgorithm* class, follow these steps:
1. Import the Class: Import the GeneticAlgorithm class from the algorithm.py file.
2. Initialize the Class: Create an instance of the GeneticAlgorithm class by passing the required arguments such as the model, population count, etc.
3. Train the Model: Call the fit method with the number of iterations, training data, and labels to start the optimization process.

Here is a simple example:

    from algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm
    import torch
    from your_model import YourModel

    # Initialize your model
    model = YourModel()

    # Parameters for the genetic algorithm
    population_count = 50
    percentage_of_parents_to_keep = 0.2
    cross_over_threshold = 0.5
    mutation_change_threshold = 0.1
    device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'

    # Initialize the genetic algorithm
    ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
        model,
        population_count,
        percentage_of_parents_to_keep,
        cross_over_threshold,
        mutation_change_threshold,
        device
    )

    # Training data and labels
    x_train = torch.Tensor(...)  # Your training data
    y_train = torch.Tensor(...)  # Your training labels

    # Fit the model
    optimized_model = ga.fit(100, x_train, y_train)  # 100 iterations
